# personal-landing

After some years I decided to make a personal website, its ironic that I'm currently more focused on the frontend than the backend and to this point I had no personal website. This change now as a practical project to improve some of my skills and to actually have a personal website.

## Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Vite

## Thiking process

I'll try and address this page as an SPA, and will try to implement the following features:

- Atomic design
- Mobile first design
- Responsive layout
- Theme toggle (dark/light)
- Animated text

All of this with ass little external dependencies as possible.

For the color palette I'll use the following colors:

- Primary: #65B891
- Secondary: #93E5AB
- Accent: #4E878C
- Text: #B5FFE1
- Background: #00140F
- Surface: #0B1F1A
